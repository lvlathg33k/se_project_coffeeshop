# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Ideas to improve the project

1. The youtube video still has a weird black line showing up at the top of the border that looks bad.
2. The last 2 sections feel like one and look unnecessarily spaced out.
3. The menu heavily deviates from the color scheme of the rest of the page.
